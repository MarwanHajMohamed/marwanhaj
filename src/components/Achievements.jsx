              is a prestigious annual showcase at Brunel University where
              students from all years present their projects to a panel of
              judges and a public audience.
              <br />
              <br />
              To win, participants must effectively communicate and demonstrate
              their work through both a live presentation and display.
              <br />
              <br />I presented my final year project, Healio, to over 100
              attendees and a panel of judges, highlighting its technical depth,
              design, and impact.
              <br />
              <br />
              My presentation impressed the judges and earned me the Winnerâ€™s
              Certificate, awarded alongside my degree.
